# Car-price-prediction
Designed and implemented an end-to-end pipeline for developing a machine learning model to predict car prices using Python.
Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to address inconsistencies and anomalies in the dataset, ensuring data integrity.
Utilized exploratory data analysis techniques to visualize relationships between car features and prices, gaining valuable insights into market dynamics.
Developed and trained a linear regression model, incorporating one-hot encoding for categorical variables and employing train-test split for model evaluation.
Achieved a high R-squared (R2) score of approximately 0.92 on test data, demonstrating the model's accuracy and reliability.
Deployed the trained model using pickle for future use, contributing to informed decision-making in the automotive market.
